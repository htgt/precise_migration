Constructor:  \f(CW\*(C`new()\*(C'\fR
.Sp
Create a List::Compare object.  Put the two lists into arrays (named or 
anonymous) and pass references to the arrays to the constructor.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    @Llist = qw(abel abel baker camera delta edward fargo golfer);
\&    @Rlist = qw(baker camera delta delta edward fargo golfer hilton);
\&
\&    $lc = List::Compare\->new(\e@Llist, \e@Rlist);
.Ve
.Sp
By default, List::Compare's methods return lists which are sorted using 
Perl's default \f(CW\*(C`sort\*(C'\fR mode:  ASCII-betical sorting.  Should you
not need to have these lists sorted, you may achieve a speed boost 
by constructing the List::Compare object with the unsorted option:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $lc = List::Compare\->new(\*(Aq\-u\*(Aq, \e@Llist, \e@Rlist);
.Ve
.Sp
or
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $lc = List::Compare\->new(\*(Aq\-\-unsorted\*(Aq, \e@Llist, \e@Rlist);
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
Alternative Constructor
.Sp
If you prefer a more explicit delineation of the types of arguments passed 
to a function, you may use this 'single hashref' kind of constructor to build a 
List::Compare object:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $lc = List::Compare\->new( { lists => [\e@Llist, \e@Rlist] } );
.Ve
.Sp
or
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    $lc = List::Compare\->new( {
\&        lists    => [\e@Llist, \e@Rlist],
\&        unsorted => 1,
\&    } );
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`get_intersection()\*(C'\fR
.Sp
Get those items which appear at least once in both lists (their intersection).
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    @intersection = $lc\->get_intersection;
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`get_union()\*(C'\fR
.Sp
Get those items which appear at least once in either list (their union).
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    @union = $lc\->get_union;
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`get_unique()\*(C'\fR
.Sp
Get those items which appear (at least once) only in the first list.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    @Lonly = $lc\->get_unique;
\&    @Lonly = $lc\->get_Lonly;    # alias
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4

.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`get_symmetric_difference()\*(C'\fR
.Sp
Get those items which appear at least once in either the first or the second 
list, but not both.
.Sp
.Vb 3

\&    @LorRonly = $lc\->get_symdiff;       # alias
\&    @LorRonly = $lc\->get_LorRonly;      # alias
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`get_bag()\*(C'\fR
.Sp
Make a bag of all those items in both lists.  The bag differs from the 
union of the two lists in that it holds as many copies of individual 
elements as appear in the original lists.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    @bag = $lc\->get_bag;
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
Return references rather than lists
.Sp
An alternative approach to the above methods:  If you do not immediately 
require an array as the return value of the method call, but simply need 
a \fIreference\fR to an (anonymous) array, use one of the following 
parallel methods:
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&    $intersection_ref = $lc\->get_intersection_ref;
\&    $union_ref        = $lc\->get_union_ref;
\&    $Lonly_ref        = $lc\->get_unique_ref;

Return a true value if the first argument passed to the constructor 
('L' for 'left') is a subset of the second argument passed to the 
constructor ('R' for 'right').
.Sp

.Vb 1

.Sp
Return a true value if the two lists passed to the constructor are 
equivalent, \fIi.e.\fR if every element in the left-hand list ('L') appears 
at least once in the right-hand list ('R') and \fIvice versa\fR.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    $eqv = $lc\->is_LequivalentR;

.Sp
Return a true value if the two lists passed to the constructor are 
disjoint, \fIi.e.\fR if the two lists have zero elements in common (or, what 
is the same thing, if their intersection is an empty set).
.Sp
.Vb 1

.Sp
.Vb 1

.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`print_equivalence_chart()\*(C'\fR
.Sp
Pretty-print a chart showing whether the two lists are equivalent (same 
elements found at least once in both).
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $lc\->print_equivalence_chart;
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4

.Sp
Determine in \fIwhich\fR (if any) of the lists passed to the constructor a given

constructor's argument list corresponding to lists holding the string being 
tested.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    @memb_arr = $lc\->is_member_which(\*(Aqabel\*(Aq);
.Ve

In the example above, \f(CW@memb_arr\fR will be:

.Sp
because \f(CW\*(Aqabel\*(Aq\fR is found only in \f(CW@Al\fR which holds position \f(CW0\fR in the 
list of arguments passed to \f(CW\*(C`new()\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
In scalar context, the return value is the number of lists passed to the 
constructor in which a given string is found.
.Sp
As with other List::Compare methods which return a list, you may wish the 
above method returned a (scalar) reference to an array holding the list:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $memb_arr_ref = $lc\->is_member_which_ref(\*(Aqbaker\*(Aq);
.Ve
.Sp
In the example above, \f(CW$memb_arr_ref\fR will be:

.Sp

only one string at a time and hence take only one argument.  To test more

.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`are_members_which()\*(C'\fR
.Sp
Determine in \fIwhich\fR (if any) of the lists passed to the constructor one or 
more given strings can be found.  The strings to be tested are placed in an 
array (named or anonymous); a reference to that array is passed to the method.
.Sp
.Vb 2

possible; the argument must now be a reference to an array.
.Sp
The return value is a reference to a hash of arrays.  The 
key for each element in this hash is the string being tested.  Each element's 
value is a reference to an anonymous array whose elements are those indices in 
the constructor's argument list corresponding to lists holding the strings 
being tested.  In the examples above, \f(CW$memb_hash_ref\fR will be:

.SH "DISCUSSION:  Principles"
.IX Header "DISCUSSION: Principles"
.SS "General Comments"
.IX Subsection "General Comments"
List::Compare is an object-oriented implementation of very common Perl 
code (see \*(L"History, References and Development\*(R" below) used to
determine interesting relationships between two or more lists at a time.  
A List::Compare object is created and automatically computes the values
needed to supply List::Compare methods with appropriate results.  In the
current implementation List::Compare methods will return new lists
containing the items found in any designated list alone (unique), any list 
other than a designated list (complement), the intersection and union of 
all lists and so forth.  List::Compare also has (a) methods to return Boolean
values indicating whether one list is a subset of another and whether any 
two lists are equivalent to each other (b) methods to pretty-print very 
simple charts displaying the subset and equivalence relationships among 
lists.
.PP
Except for List::Compare's \f(CW\*(C`get_bag()\*(C'\fR method, \fBmultiple instances of 
an element in a given list count only once with 
respect to computing the intersection, union, etc. of the two lists.\fR  In 
particular, List::Compare considers two lists as equivalent if each element 
of the first list can be found in the second list and \fIvice versa\fR.  
\&'Equivalence' in this usage takes no note of the frequency with which 
elements occur in either list or their order within the lists.  List::Compare 
asks the question:  \fIDid I see this item in this list at all?\fR  Only when 
you use \f(CW\*(C`List::Compare::get_bag()\*(C'\fR to compute a bag holding the two lists do you 
ask the question:  How many times did this item occur in this list?
.SS "List::Compare Modes"
.IX Subsection "List::Compare Modes"
In its current implementation List::Compare has four modes of operation.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Regular Mode
.Sp
List::Compare's Regular mode is based on List::Compare v0.11 \*(-- the first 
version of List::Compare released to \s-1CPAN \s0(June 2002).  It compares only 
two lists at a time.  Internally, its initializer does all computations 
needed to report any desired comparison and its constructor stores the 
results of these computations.  Its public methods merely report these 
results.
.Sp
This approach has the advantage that if you need to examine more 
than one form of comparison between two lists (\fIe.g.,\fR the union, 
intersection and symmetric difference of two lists), the comparisons are 
pre-calculated.  This approach is efficient because certain types of 
comparison presuppose that other types have already been calculated.  
For example, to calculate the symmetric difference of two lists, one must 
first determine the items unique to each of the two lists.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Accelerated Mode
.Sp
The current implementation of List::Compare offers you the option of 
getting even faster results \fIprovided\fR that you only need the 
result from a \fIsingle\fR form of comparison between two lists. (\fIe.g.,\fR only 
the union \*(-- nothing else).  In the Accelerated mode, List::Compare's 
initializer does no computation and its constructor stores only references 
to the two source lists.  All computation needed to report results is 
deferred to the method calls.
.Sp
The user selects this approach by passing the option flag \f(CW\*(Aq\-a\*(Aq\fR to the 
constructor before passing references to the two source lists.  
List::Compare notes the option flag and silently switches into Accelerated 
mode.  From the perspective of the user, there is no further difference in 
the code or in the results.
.Sp
Benchmarking suggests that List::Compare's Accelerated mode (a) is faster 
than its Regular mode when only one comparison is requested; (b) is about as 
fast as Regular mode when two comparisons are requested; and (c) becomes 
considerably slower than Regular mode as each additional comparison above two 
is requested.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Multiple Mode
.Sp
List::Compare now offers the possibility of comparing three or more lists at 
a time.  Simply store the extra lists in arrays and pass references to those 
arrays to the constructor.  List::Compare detects that more than two lists 
have been passed to the constructor and silently switches into Multiple mode.
.Sp
As described in the Synopsis above, comparing more than two lists at a time 
offers you a wider, more complex palette of comparison methods.  
Individual items may appear in just one source list, in all the source lists, 
or in some number of lists between one and all.  The meaning of 'union', 
\&'intersection' and 'symmetric difference' is conceptually unchanged 
when you move to multiple lists because these are properties of all the lists 
considered together.  In contrast, the meaning of 'unique', 'complement', 
\&'subset' and 'equivalent' changes because these are properties of one list 
compared with another or with all the other lists combined.
.Sp
List::Compare takes this complexity into account by allowing you to pass 
arguments to the public methods requesting results with respect to a specific 
list (for \f(CW\*(C`get_unique()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`get_complement()\*(C'\fR) or a specific pair of lists 
(for \f(CW\*(C`is_LsubsetR()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`is_LequivalentR()\*(C'\fR).
.Sp
List::Compare further takes this complexity into account by offering the 
new methods \f(CW\*(C`get_shared()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`get_nonintersection()\*(C'\fR described in the 
Synopsis above.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Multiple Accelerated Mode
.Sp
Beginning with version 0.25, introduced in April 2004, List::Compare 
offers the possibility of accelerated computation of a single comparison 
among three or more lists at a time.  Simply store the extra lists in 
arrays and pass references to those arrays to the constructor preceded by 
the \f(CW\*(Aq\-a\*(Aq\fR argument as was done with the simple (two lists only) 
accelerated mode.  List::Compare detects that more than two lists have been 
passed to the constructor and silently switches into Multiple Accelerated 
mode.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Unsorted Option
.Sp
When List::Compare is used to return lists representing various comparisons 
of two or more lists (\fIe.g.\fR, the lists' union or intersection), the lists 
returned are, by default, sorted using Perl's default \f(CW\*(C`sort\*(C'\fR mode:  
ASCII-betical sorting.  Sorting produces results which are more easily 
human-readable but may entail a performance cost.
.Sp
Should you not need sorted results, you can avoid the potential 
performance cost by calling List::Compare's constructor using the unsorted 
option.  This is done by calling \f(CW\*(Aq\-u\*(Aq\fR or \f(CW\*(Aq\-\-unsorted\*(Aq\fR as the first 
argument passed to the constructor, \fIi.e.\fR, as an argument called before 
any references to lists are passed to the constructor.
.Sp
Note that if are calling List::Compare in the Accelerated or Multiple 
Accelerated mode \fIand\fR wish to have the lists returned in unsorted order, 
you \fIfirst\fR pass the argument for the unsorted option 
(\f(CW\*(Aq\-u\*(Aq\fR or \f(CW\*(Aq\-\-unsorted\*(Aq\fR) and \fIthen\fR pass the argument for the 
Accelerated mode (\f(CW\*(Aq\-a\*(Aq\fR or \f(CW\*(Aq\-\-accelerated\*(Aq\fR).
.SS "Miscellaneous Methods"
.IX Subsection "Miscellaneous Methods"
It would not really be appropriate to call \f(CW\*(C`get_shared()\*(C'\fR and 
\&\f(CW\*(C`get_nonintersection()\*(C'\fR in Regular or Accelerated mode since they are 
conceptually based on the notion of comparing more than two lists at a time.  
However, there is always the possibility that a user may be comparing only two 
lists (accelerated or not) and may accidentally call one of those two methods.  
To prevent fatal run-time errors and to caution you to use a more 
appropriate method, these two methods are defined for Regular and Accelerated 
modes so as to return suitable results but also generate a carp message that 
advise you to re-code.
.PP
Similarly, the method \f(CW\*(C`is_RsubsetL()\*(C'\fR is appropriate for the Regular and 
Accelerated modes but is not really appropriate for Multiple mode.  As a 
defensive maneuver, it has been defined for Multiple mode so as to return 
suitable results but also to generate a carp message that advises you to 
re-code.
.PP
In List::Compare v0.11 and earlier, the author provided aliases for various 
methods based on the supposition that the source lists would be referred to as 
\&'A' and 'B'.  Now that you can compare more than two lists at a time, the author 
feels that it would be more appropriate to refer to the elements of two-argument 
lists as the left-hand and right-hand elements.  Hence, we are discouraging the 
use of methods such as \f(CW\*(C`get_Aonly()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`get_Bonly()\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`get_AorBonly()\*(C'\fR as 
aliases for \f(CW\*(C`get_unique()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`get_complement()\*(C'\fR and 
\&\f(CW\*(C`get_symmetric_difference()\*(C'\fR.  However, to guarantee backwards compatibility 
for the vast audience of Perl programmers using earlier versions of 
List::Compare (all 10e1 of you) these and similar methods for subset 
relationships are still defined.
.SS "List::Compare::SeenHash Discontinued Beginning with Version 0.26"
.IX Subsection "List::Compare::SeenHash Discontinued Beginning with Version 0.26"
Prior to v0.26, introduced April 11, 2004, if a user wished to pass 
references to seen-hashes to List::Compare's constructor rather than 
references to arrays, he or she had to call a different, parallel module:

\&    );
\&
\&    my $lcsh = List::Compare::SeenHash\->new(\e%Llist, \e%Rlist);
.Ve
.PP
\&\fBList::Compare::SeenHash is deprecated beginning with version 0.26.\fR  All 
its functionality (and more) has been implemented in List::Compare itself, 
since a user can now pass \fIeither\fR a series of array references \fIor\fR a

.PP

will no longer be distributed with List::Compare, nor will the files in the 
test suite which tested List::Compare::SeenHash upon installation be distributed.

.SS "A Non-Object-Oriented Interface:  List::Compare::Functional"
.IX Subsection "A Non-Object-Oriented Interface: List::Compare::Functional"
Version 0.21 of List::Compare introduced List::Compare::Functional, 
a functional (\fIi.e.\fR, non-object-oriented) interface to list comparison 
functions.  List::Compare::Functional supports the same functions currently 
supported by List::Compare.  It works similar to List::Compare's Accelerated 
and Multiple Accelerated modes (described above), bit it does not 
require use of the \f(CW\*(Aq\-a\*(Aq\fR flag in the function call.  
List::Compare::Functional will return unsorted comparisons of two lists by 
passing \f(CW\*(Aq\-u\*(Aq\fR or \f(CW\*(Aq\-\-unsorted\*(Aq\fR as the first argument to the function.  
Please see the documentation for List::Compare::Functional to learn how to 
import its functions into your main package.
.SH "ASSUMPTIONS AND QUALIFICATIONS"
.IX Header "ASSUMPTIONS AND QUALIFICATIONS"
The program was created with Perl 5.6. The use of \fIh2xs\fR to prepare 
the module's template installed \f(CW\*(C`require 5.005_62;\*(C'\fR at the top of the
module.  This has been commented out in the actual module as the code 
appears to be compatible with earlier versions of Perl; how earlier the 
author cannot say.  In particular, the author would like the module to 
be installable on older versions of MacPerl.  As is, the author has 
successfully installed the module on Linux, Windows 9x and Windows 2000.

.SS "The Code Itself"
.IX Subsection "The Code Itself"
List::Compare is based on code presented by Tom Christiansen & Nathan
Torkington in \fIPerl Cookbook\fR <http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/cookbook/>
(a.k.a. the 'Ram' book), O'Reilly & Associates, 1998, Recipes 4.7 and 4.8. 
Similar code is presented in the Camel book:  \fIProgramming Perl\fR, by Larry
Wall, Tom Christiansen, Jon Orwant. 
<http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pperl3/>, 3rd ed, O'Reilly & Associates,
2000.  The list comparison code is so basic and Perlish that I suspect it
may have been written by Larry himself at the dawn of Perl time.  The 
\&\f(CW\*(C`get_bag()\*(C'\fR method was inspired by Jarkko Hietaniemi's Set::Bag module
and Daniel Berger's Set::Array module, both available on \s-1CPAN.\s0
.PP
List::Compare's original objective was simply to put this code in a modular, 
object-oriented framework.  That framework, not surprisingly, is taken mostly 
from Damian Conway's \fIObject Oriented Perl\fR 
<http://www.manning.com/Conway/index.html>, Manning Publications, 2000.
.PP
With the addition of the Accelerated, Multiple and Multiple Accelerated 
modes, List::Compare expands considerably in both size and capabilities.  
Nonetheless,  Tom and Nat's \fICookbook\fR code still lies at its core:  
the use of hashes as look-up tables to record elements seen in lists.  
Please note:  List::Compare is not concerned with any concept of 'equality' 
among lists which hinges upon the frequency with which, or the order in 
which, elements appear in the lists to be compared.  If this does not 
meet your needs, you should look elsewhere or write your own module.
.SS "The Inspiration"
.IX Subsection "The Inspiration"
I realized the usefulness of putting the list comparison code into a
module while preparing an introductory level Perl course given at the New
School University's Computer Instruction Center in April-May 2002.  I was
comparing lists left and right.  When I found myself writing very similar
functions in different scripts, I knew a module was lurking somewhere. 
I learned the truth of the mantra ''Repeated Code is a Mistake'' from a 
2001 talk by Mark-Jason Dominus <http://perl.plover.com/> to the New York 
Perlmongers <http://ny.pm.org/>.  
See <http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2000/11/repair3.html>.
.PP
The first public presentation of this module took place at Perl Seminar 
New York <http://groups.yahoo.com/group/perlsemny> on May 21, 2002.  
Comments and suggestions were provided there and since by Glenn Maciag, 
Gary Benson, Josh Rabinowitz, Terrence Brannon and Dave Cross.
.PP
The placement in the installation tree of Test::ListCompareSpecial came 
as a result of a question answered by Michael Graham in his talk 
\&''Test::More to Test::Extreme'' given at Yet Another Perl Conference::Canada 
in Ottawa, Ontario, on May 16, 2003.
.PP
In May-June 2003, Glenn Maciag made valuable suggestions which led to 
changes in method names and documentation in v0.20.
.PP
Another presentation at Perl Seminar New York in 
October 2003 prompted me to begin planning List::Compare::Functional.
.PP
In a November 2003 Perl Seminar New York presentation, Ben Holtzman 
discussed the performance costs entailed in Perl's \f(CW\*(C`sort\*(C'\fR function.  
This led me to ask, ''Why should a user of List::Compare pay this performance 
cost if he or she doesn't need a human-readable list as a result (as 
would be the case if the list returned were used as the input into some 
other function)?''  This led to the development of List::Compare's 
unsorted option.
.PP
An April 2004 offer by Kevin Carlson to write an article for \fIThe Perl Journal\fR 
(<http://tpj.com>) led me to re-think whether a separate module 
(the former List::Compare::SeenHash) was truly needed when a user wanted 
to provide the constructor with references to seen-hashes rather than 
references to arrays.  Since I had already adapted List::Compare::Functional 
to accept both kinds of arguments, I adapted List::Compare in the same 
manner.  This meant that List::Compare::SeenHash and its related installation 
tests could be deprecated and deleted from the \s-1CPAN\s0 distribution.
.PP
A remark by David H. Adler at a New York Perlmongers meeting in April 2004 
led me to develop the 'single hashref' alternative constructor format, 
introduced in version 0.29 the following month.
.PP
Presentations at two different editions of Yet Another Perl Conference (\s-1YAPC\s0) 
inspired the development of List::Compare versions 0.30 and 0.31.  I was 
selected to give a talk on List::Compare at \s-1YAPC::NA::2004\s0 in Buffalo.  This 
spurred me to improve certain aspects of the documentation.  Version 0.31 
owes its inspiration to one talk at the Buffalo \s-1YAPC\s0 and one earlier talk at 
\&\s-1YAPC::EU::2003\s0 in Paris.  In Paris I heard Paul Johnson speak on his \s-1CPAN \s0
module Devel::Cover and on coverage analysis more generally.  That material 
was over my head at that time, but in Buffalo I heard Andy Lester discuss 
Devel::Cover as part of his discussion of testing and of the Phalanx project 
(<http://qa.perl.org/phalanx>).  This time I got it, and when I returned 
from Buffalo I applied Devel::Cover to List::Compare and wrote additional tests 
to improve its subroutine and statement coverage.  In addition, I added two 
new methods, \f(CW\*(C`get_unique_all\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`get_complement_all\*(C'\fR.  In writing these 
two methods, I followed a model of test-driven development much more so than 
in earlier versions of List::Compare and my other \s-1CPAN\s0 modules.  The result?  
List::Compare's test suite grew by over 3300 tests to nearly 23,000 tests.

the Unix \f(CW\*(C`diff\*(C'\fR utility  and you're on the right track.  Algorithm::Diff
exports 
methods such as \f(CW\*(C`diff\*(C'\fR, which ''computes the smallest set of additions and 
deletions necessary to turn the first sequence into the second, and returns a 
description of these changes.''  Algorithm::Diff is mainly concerned with the 
sequence of elements within two lists.  It does not export functions for 
intersection, union, subset status, etc.

Array::Compare \- Perl extension for comparing arrays
(<http://search.cpan.org/dist/Array\-Compare/>)
.Sp
Array::Compare, by Dave Cross, asks whether two arrays
are the same or different by doing a \f(CW\*(C`join\*(C'\fR on each string with a
separator character and comparing the resulting strings.  Like
List::Compare, it is an object-oriented module.  A sophisticated feature of
Array::Compare is that it allows you to specify how 'whitespace' in an
array (an element which is undefined, the empty string, or whitespace
within an element) should be evaluated for purpose of determining equality
or difference.    It does not directly provide methods for intersection and
union.

List::Util \- A selection of general-utility list subroutines
(<http://search.cpan.org/dist/Scalar\-List\-Utils/>)
.Sp
List::Util, by Graham Barr, exports a variety of simple,
useful functions for operating on one list at a time.    The \f(CW\*(C`min\*(C'\fR function
returns the lowest numerical value in a list; the \f(CW\*(C`max\*(C'\fR function returns
the highest value; and so forth.  List::Compare differs from List::Util in
that it is object-oriented and that it works on two strings at a time
rather than just one \*(-- but it aims to be as simple and useful as
List::Util.  List::Util will be included in the standard Perl 
distribution as of Perl 5.8.0.
.Sp
Lists::Util (<http://search.cpan.org/dist/List\-MoreUtils/>), 
by Tassilo von Parseval, building on code by Terrence Brannon, provides
methods 
which extend List::Util's functionality.

Quantum::Superpositions 
(<http://search.cpan.org/dist/Quantum\-Superpositions/>), 
originally by Damian Conway, now maintained by Steven Lembark is useful if, in 
addition to comparing lists, you need to emulate quantum supercomputing as
well.  
Not for the eigen-challenged.

Set::Scalar \- basic set operations
(<http://search.cpan.org/dist/Set\-Scalar/>)
.Sp
Set::Bag \- bag (multiset) class
(<http://search.cpan.org/dist/Set\-Bag/>)
.Sp
Both of these modules are by Jarkko Hietaniemi.  Set::Scalar
has methods to return the intersection, union, difference and symmetric
difference of two sets, as well as methods to return items unique to a
first set and complementary to it in a second set.  It has methods for
reporting considerably more variants on subset status than does
List::Compare.  However, benchmarking suggests that List::Compare, at 
least in Regular mode, is considerably faster than Set::Scalar for those 
comparison methods which List::Compare makes available.
.Sp
Set::Bag enables one to deal more flexibly with the situation in which one
has more than one instance of an element in a list.

Set::Array \- Arrays as objects with lots of handy methods (including set
comparisons) and support for method chaining.
(<http://search.cpan.org/dist/Set\-Array/>)
.Sp
Set::Array, by Daniel Berger, now maintained by Ron Savage, ''aims to provide
built-in methods for operations that people are always asking how to do,and
which already exist in languages like Ruby.''  Among the many methods in
this module are some for intersection, union, etc.  To install Set::Array,
you must first install the Want module, also available on \s-1CPAN.\s0
